Certain episodes are worse than others, but horning over schoolgirls keeps coming back by our adult MC teacher.

ldvjw4f,"There is a lot wrong with this list but the biggest thing for me is: How in the hell does one classify Mushishi as ""light spiritual mysteries""?

Mushishi has to be among the most heartwrenching shows I've seen. 

Guy walks around in a stagnant backwards world terrorized by mindless ""things"" that are 1/3 bacteria, 1/3 dangerous spirits and 1/3 parasites. The ""things"" effectively hinder all progress because the make life so hard, so now the world is stuck forever in the late middle ages, with all the poverty and strife related to that.
Why does he walk around? See he had his life ruined by these ""things"" that terrorize the world and now he is basically cursed to have them flock around him, and since he is a decent guy he can never stay in one place for more than a short while, thus causing him to be alone forever with no real connections to anyone. 
How does he survive then, not being able to put down roots or even have a home? Well, because of his curse, he has come to know the ""things"" very well and has learnt partially how to handle them, so in his travels he works as a plague doctor/exorcist/investigator/shaman. The only problem is that you usually don't notice the symptoms of the ""things"" until it's too late, so in most cases the best thing he can do is provide some poor man's version of closure to the grief stricken family/village. Then it is time to go, just when he has started to form some connection, before his curse calls down more misfortune on the poor souls living there, so on to the next soul killing tragedy we go. Rinse and repeat every episode.

It is a damn good show, but ""light spiritual mysteries"" it is not. More ""the soul killing fate of a cursed plague doctor"".",lot wrong list biggest thing hell one classify mushishi light spiritual mystery mushishi among heartwrenching show seen guy walk around stagnant backwards world terrorized mindless thing bacteria dangerous spirit parasite thing effectively hinder progress make life hard world stuck forever late middle age poverty strife related walk around see life ruined thing terrorize world basically cursed flock around since decent guy never stay one place short thus causing alone forever real connection anyone survive able put root even home well curse come know thing well learnt partially handle travel work plague doctor exorcist investigator shaman problem usually notice symptom thing late case best thing provide poor man version closure grief stricken family village time go started form connection curse call misfortune poor soul living next soul killing tragedy go rinse repeat every episode damn good show light spiritual mystery soul killing fate cursed plague doctor,0

ic2xc2z,"I think that everything you're saying here is a part of why I love HXH so much. There is no cut and dry ""wants to destroy the world"" antagonist in HunterXHunter. The antagonists are simply fucked up human beings (and ants!) with skewed morals. 

Hisoka is a dude who gets off through fighting strong opponents. Full stop. He does not give a fuck if those opponents are children, and is in fact grooming Gon to be even stronger, so that he can fight him in the future. These are the facts of the show. He's not even once painted as a character we're supposed to have sympathy for. In fact, I'd go so far as to say he's one of the only characters in HXH that is written as a completely self-serving psycho. His relationship with Gon and Killua is one of the highlights of the show. Uncomfortable, sure, but a brilliant subversion of the typical shounen mentor.

I also feel that the boys (specifically Gon) refusing to team with the spiders but being a lot less wary around Hisoka is indicative of the fact that he is a fucking 12 year old child. He sees everything in black and white, good and evil, and because Hisoka has helped them in his own way he is on the ""good"" side. This is a major theme of the show, and specifically Gon's character arc, which of course culminates in the Chimera Ant Arc.

I guess everything you're saying you disliked I found to be well written and thought provoking.",think everything saying part love hxh much cut dry want destroy world antagonist hunterxhunter antagonist simply fucked human being ant skewed moral hisoka dude get fighting strong opponent full stop give fuck opponent child fact grooming gon even stronger fight future fact show even painted character supposed sympathy fact go far say one character hxh written completely self serving psycho relationship gon killua one highlight show uncomfortable sure brilliant subversion typical shounen mentor also feel boy specifically gon refusing team spider lot less wary around hisoka indicative fact fucking year old child see everything black white good evil hisoka helped way good side major theme show specifically gon character arc course culminates chimera ant arc guess everything saying disliked found well written thought provoking,0

In the case of Hunter x Hunter though it largely was, most of the changes in the 1999 version made the series drastically worse. Togashi isn't some kind of awful writer that needs an anime director to come in and pick up the pieces of his dumpster fire story and reassemble it into something decent. He's actually pretty good at writing as it turns out.

Like, pretty sure before this scene we get an anime-original filler story involving one of Killua's assassination victims. There was at least some ounce of uncertainty and tension before this scene as to what exactly Killua meant when he called himself an assassin, or what kind of character he had, but that filler kinda ruined a major part of the impact of this scene, which was supposed to be the first time we really get an understanding into his character.",manga faithful always plus case hunter x hunter though largely change version made series drastically worse togashi kind awful writer need anime director come pick piece dumpster fire story reassemble something decent actually pretty good writing turn like pretty sure scene get anime original filler story involving one killua assassination victim least ounce uncertainty tension scene exactly killua meant called assassin kind character filler kinda ruined major part impact scene supposed first time really get understanding character,0

Then there is Mr. Villain's Day Off! One of my favorites that I'm always excited to see a new chapter for, it's a very fluffy series. There's also Cherry Magic! which I couldn't get into so I'm hoping the anime will change my mind.

kftp72h,"Alright, my list is a bit off.

For continuing, I got-

- Frieren, cause obviously. 

- Shangri-la Frontier, I didn't expect to enjoy this so much.

- Apothecary Diaries, I don't know why, I just keep getting pulled in.

New series-

- weakest tamer, trash picking - the production in the PVs absolutely blew me away. There's not a single isekai this season with better production than this one.... HOW?! I'm excited, genuinely excited. I'm expecting a 7/10.

- Solo Leveling - it's probably gonna be **the** show of the season everyone will be talking about so... Yeah. Since people have been hyping this up to no end, I'm expecting at least an 8/10.

- gushing over magical girls - Yes

- Slave isekai - Yes

- Mashle reason 2 - I enjoyed season 1 enough to give this a shot. I don't expect anything different from Season 1 so I'm expecting a 7/10.

- Yubisaki renren - not particularly interested in the plot, but the production looks nice. It's probably not my type of story, so I might end up giving this a 6 or 7. (this could change, I love fruits basket and silent voice a lot) 

- Dangers in my Heart 2nd season - this is one of my two long most anticipated shows ever since last year. I loved the duo's chemistry in the first season, I want to see them progress more. I'm expecting anywhere from an 8 to a 9.

- Akuyaku 99 - The MC is cute. This'll probably be a 5/10. 

- Metallic Rouge - this feels more obligatory for me as a celebration of animation (Studio Bones' 25th anniversary), it's possibly the story will just fall flat on its face, but at the very least the production is gonna be absolute fire. I'm expecting anywhere from 6/10 to 9/10

- Sengoku Youko - This is the other one I've long since been anticipating. Though my attachment to this is more so due to the story behind the scenes rather than the manga itself, I'm still looking forward to the story since manga readers swear that this'll be peak. I'm expecting a good 7/10.

- Witch and the beast - as long as I get a good atmosphere from this one as the PVs suggested, imma be happy.

- 7 Loop - I thought the MC was cute.

- Dungeon Meshi - It's by studio trigger.

- torture princess - Looks like a good comfy turn my brain off show.

- Classroom of the Elite S3 - I honestly don't know why I'm continuing to watch after season 1 and 2 butchered the source. Season 3 will be cramming 5 volumes into 3 cours, talk about butcher.

- Mofumofu isekai - Looks cute. Cuddling animals.

Then the shows that aren't airing this season

- Tryna finish Cutie Honey so I can move on to the next one.

- The Legend of Basara, I don't know what to expect with this one.

- Do it yourself!!, I plan on picking it up again. Idk why I dropped it tbh.

- Danmachi, after many years, it's about time I try finishing the first season..

- Otonari Tenshi sama, season 2 seems like it's coming soon. I gotta catch up to season 1

- Romantic Killer, I only got up to Episode 6 before, I plan on finishing it.

The story also has a bunch of really clever/clever seeming puzzles/challenges that make the fights a little bit more than just ""i punch harder i win hehe""

I actually love the weirder parts of it and the odd pacing.

Sure some bits might have been about Togashi having written himself into a corner a bit (or fully intentional) but, if you buy into the whole idea, it works really well. 

[Spoiler about that narrative thing:](/s ""At some point it kinda clicked for me that the whole extreme slow motion aspect of the narrative paralleled the difference between, for example, Netero and lesser fighters. We got a look into the world of those individuals and having long stretches of time in an episode that are actually barely seconds does odd things to the pacing, especially if you have stuff happening at the same time in different places. But telling the story this way was a rather neat experience overall.

kpgai37,"> Does the show get a lot better past episode 2 or something? Katanagatari's dialogue isn't good enough to keep me interested

If you don't like it by the end of the second episode, it's probaby not your cup of tea. As you said, 95% of it is just talking. Fights are short and to-the-point, usually the main confrontation is at 50m-55m in the episode and that's it.

> What about Katanagatari do you really like?

Imaginative world concept. It's the most creative anime setting ever imo, though you might need a little background on Japan to fully see what it's doing. (Hint: There is no such thing as a Yanari Shogunate IRL. This is alt history where the warring states period took a wild turn at some point.)

It's a tragedy written with the cadence of a comedy. The dialogue is fun and the concepts are whimsical, so watching an episode goes down easy, but once it's in your stomach, it has a lot of pathos. It conceals drama up a colorful sleeve and then unsheathes it with a flourish when you least expect.

I find Togame and Shichika very funny characters. Their interactions form a lot of the beat-by-beat enjoyment of the show. The enjoyment comes in part from knowing what they're bantering about will become relevant in unexpected ways later.",show get lot better past episode something katanagatari dialogue good enough keep interested like end second episode probaby cup tea said talking fight short point usually main confrontation episode katanagatari really like imaginative world concept creative anime setting ever imo though might need little background japan fully see hint thing yanari shogunate irl alt history warring state period took wild turn point tragedy written cadence comedy dialogue fun concept whimsical watching episode go easy stomach lot pathos conceals drama colorful sleeve unsheathes flourish least expect find togame shichika funny character interaction form lot beat beat enjoyment show enjoyment come part knowing bantering become relevant unexpected way later,1

kpfer77,"> so the MC doesn't need to be a good person. 

Never said otherwise, the problem with Mushoku is tone and framing. The whole show is _incredibly_ tone-deaf when it comes to sexual assault, harassment, and pedophilia, and it's not just Rudeus either. You can have a complete monster as a protagonist as long as you actually frame them that way.

The show routinely treats these subjects with a light tone or even as a joke, despite pretending to take these things seriously on the surface. Again, this isn't just about characters being flawed it's about how scenes are portrayed to the viewer.

One of the worst examples is Rudeus being with Eris despite having spent the whole series grooming her. If it had been framed as Rudeus fucking up again that would've been one thing, but instead it's practically portrayed as rewarding him for character growth that he didn't actually have.

There's a reason I say people who defend MT have poor media literacy.

> Do you also have a problem with American Beauty/GoT/Euphoria?

The only one of those I've even heard of is GoT, and I only ever read the first book, never watched the show (don't watch many live action TV/movies).

If the show continued portraying him as a piece of shit (or indeed treated sexual harassment and pedophilia with a serious tone in general), we wouldn't be having this conversation.

The problem is that it doesn't.

> His bad behaviour is not excused but rather chastised by the author: every time he acts like a perv or thinks with his dick he gets beat up or breaks a relationship

In the beginning of the show, yes. Later on, not really. And the show has one of the worst cases of tone mismatch I've seen - the writing chastises on the surface while still behaving like a normal ecchi in how its actually shown to the viewer.

> I don't consider him a pedo because I don't consider him an adult: this is the story about a human failure getting a second chance at life

This is exactly what I mean by the fandom lying about the contents of the show. Unlike most isekais, MT goes out of its way to make it very explicit that Rudeus retains is full mental age and adult identity from the very beginning. He IS an adult in all the ways that matter for this.

> That would be like considering a murderer still a murdered after he got released from prison: what was the point of setting him free then?

More like if a murderer is let out and starts stabbing people but not to the point of actually killing them, and then the story acts like he's fine now and doesn't need any further improvement.

And as I've said repeatedly, the problem isn't just Rudeus, the whole show has this issue where it the tone as presented to the viewer doesn't match what's actually happening.

>  to take into consideration his previous life it's tantamount to refusing the possibility of redempion/second chances altogether 

He doesn't get better though, not on this issue which only makes it more glaring since he does improve in other ways unrelated to pedophilia/harassment.

> It takes a lot of time, and happens very gradually, but Rudeus does grow as a person: the relationships he builds from the school arc onwards are absolutely healthy (with one possible ecception)

The fact that he's still with Eris _at all_ later puts the lie to that (that entire relationship is built on deception and worse), and again it's not just Rudeus' actions that are the problem, it's how they're framed. It's like the author (much like the fanbase, unsurprisingly) genuinely does not understand how bad Rudeus' actions still are even later on.

And that last part is exactly why I give the show so much shit. I don't think MT fans are pedos, but I absolutely think their moral compasses and understanding of healthy human interaction are warped.

It's perfectly reasonable for him to end up with Eris: they spent years in a really harsh situation together, and that forges bonds

There was that one big fight that was just like giant robots and lasers or something...but I barely remember.

[Comparing against 5 years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/d58ycg/the_results_of_the_ranime_classics_of_anime_poll/) (from which I also reused the format) we don't have the same issue of ""recent popular shows"" climbing well up the list, and some vintage shows jumped way up. Super cool result to see honestly.

Reposted because there was some mistakes I had made and corrected, but never actually saved the changes to the file. Well played. Hopefully there will be fewer mistakes now.

Along with that, in the pantheon of GOAT-tier anime, would be all of the Ghibli movies by Hayao Miyazaki, with Spirited Away probably being the most famous, but also Kiki's Delivery Service and many others. Also just about the best there is the genre.

The story follows a young ex-soldier whose recent employment at a postal company tasks her with writing letters that can connect people, all the while trying to reintegrate back into normal society and find a new purpose in life. It isn't as action packed or geared towards a young male demographic as the shows your BF has suggested, but it has some really poignant moments and the animation is just a treat for the eyes. Kaguya Sama Love Is War is another really good one to watch, with a lot of heart and humor that appeals to a broad audience. Love Is War centers around the typical Japanese highschool setting, so the comedy can come across as a little cringe, but it's still a fun time overall. The show has several seasons out with more likely to come, so if you enjoy the first few episodes then you have a lot to look forward to. One last suggestion if you want to stick with the action genre is Vinland Saga. It revolves around Vikings and the main character's quest for revenge against the man who killed his father. The show definitely gave me some early Game of Thrones vibes. I found the English dubs for all three shows to be really well executed.

kp50exf,"90% of what I watch is comedy or slice of life. The format for these isn't all that different from traditional sitcoms except for the fact that most shows only last 1 season (12 or 13 episodes). In any given season, there are 25+ shows to watch on top of the thousands that already exist.

The kind of anime you see get talked about the most are battle shows. But there are plenty of shows with no fighting, no supernatural or fantasy elements, and shows with adult casts. There's an unending stream of opinions on what's good but a pretty good place to start is MyAnimeList which is a lot like IMDB in that the ratings are crowdsourced. Just know that the ratings are heavily skewed towards the kind of stuff that appeals to 17 year old boys.

kp5pckb,"A lot of the suggestions for movies on here are great, I think your bf's suggestions are good but they're straight into relatively large time commitments. I would recommend

BACCANO - a little sci-fi, a little noir, quite funny and a genuinely great dub if you don't like reading subtitles. 16 episodes total.

Buddy Daddies - light-hearted comedy family drama about 2 assassins that accidentally adopt a young child. Think 3 men and baby meets Mr and Mrs Smith. 12 episodes and very easy to watch.

Hinamatsuri - weird funny show about a girl with psychic powers from another dimension that ends up being taken care of by a gangster. 12 episodes.

If you start to get into it at all the most common suggestion would be Fullmetal Alchemist. It's usually sorting at the top of the anime rankings.

The one i see most people recommend is Love is War as it's very funny, the dub is equally as well voice acted as the subtitled version, and I think it's enjoyed by men and women equally.  It is somewhat of a parody of anime high school romcom so some jokes are geared towards anime audiences.

If historic fantasy is ok, not magic and dragons but like period dramas you may like Apothecary Diaries it's currently airing.  It is an episodic whodunit set in a fictional medieval chinese royal court.  The dub, while ok for what it is, isn't as good as the subtitled version.

Spy Family is a solid entry point as well.  It's a comedy that takes place in a fictional cold war European country.  The main character is a spy for one nation and needs to assemble a cover family to spy in the rival nation.  He adopts an little girl who is an esper and proposes to an assassin who works for the rival nation.

When I first started, there wasn't a whole lot of anime available to me; mainly whatever dubbed series was running on toonami, and whatever VHS's were being passed around my school anime club.  At that time I would watch almost everything I could get my hands on. even if it wasn't a genre I preferred.  Later, when I set up my MAL account and started rating all those older series that I may not have loved, but watched anyway; I would give them lower ratings.  

Fast forward 20 years, and the pool of currently airing anime available to me is vastly increased.  This, combined greater constraints on my time mean that I neither have the time nor the desire to watch every available anime, every season.  So as a result I filter curate my way though the new anime every season, and only watch those that interest me, and as a result I will tend to rate most of the my current viewings higher than most of my viewings from the 90's, because I only am watching showing that I think I will really enjoy.

hlpbzf9,"I commend you for writing *that* much to explain why you can‚Äôt recommend and point out it‚Äôs main problem. 

Ultimately, it‚Äôs ends up on ‚ÄúRudeus doesn‚Äôt suffer any consequence‚Äù. 

TL;DR : Rudeus‚Äô flaw is not treated as a flaw, when it should be in the context of the story. 

Now ofcourse there won‚Äôt be any societal consequences of his actions. People won‚Äôt punish him, he won‚Äôt go to jail, because everything he does is just how it is in that world. 

BUT that doesn‚Äôt mean the individual characters that Rudeus ‚Äúhurts‚Äù through his actions should forgive him. 

Using the example of two redemption stories : 

[A Silent Voice]>!Shouya‚Äôs bullying Shouko led to him getting bullied too. It destroyed his school life. He suffered from anxiety and lost all confidence, ultimately ending up attempting to suicide. Shouko‚Äôs life gets fucked up too, so much that she attends special schools. Friendships fall apart.!<. That‚Äôs consequence. **Thats how you show that bullying someone is a flaw. That it‚Äôs a horrible action**. Everything isn‚Äôt forgiven later on. Shouya does his utmost best to atone, and apologise. 

[Vinland Saga]>!Thorfin killing people leads his life to be absolutely fucked up. Thousands of people resent him. He suffers from those hatred. He has PTSD. The families he‚Äôs destroyed all hate him. He can‚Äôt even sleep after everything, properly. He sees nightmares every single night!<. That‚Äôs consequence. **Thats how you show that murdering/killing people is a problem. That it‚Äôs a horrible action.** Everything doesn‚Äôt get better after a while for Thorfinn either. The demons, regrets, tragedy, horror, it all sticks with him. 

What happens in MT ? Well, Rudeus sexually assaults the little girls. Steals their panties. Gropes them while they are sleeping. Thinks of grooming them. No problem. The little girl he‚Äôs about to rape, ends up saying ‚Äúwe can do it when you‚Äôre an adult‚Äù. Paul rapes a woman. Said woman years later rapes him back, and entertains him while his wife‚Äôs pregnant. Paul cheats on his wife, said family is perfectly fine after an argument. 

It‚Äôs like the show knows it‚Äôs characters are involved in a horrible action (they call each other out on it, think them as trash, but only for jokes), but it fails to present these actions in a bad light. Everything‚Äôs totally fine after these actions. 

The characters involved just don‚Äôt show any consequence of said horrible actions. Eris and Sylphie wouldn‚Äôt get close to a kid who have sexually assaulted them or forcefully taken off their clothes, let alone promising sex later. It‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ nonsensical. No one grows trust issues here. No Trauma. No insecurities. It hurts the characters and the writing, and for people expecting a redemption story, Rudeus‚Äô character goes past being redeemed after all this, even more so because he just never faces consequences.",commend writing much explain recommend point main problem ultimately end rudeus suffer consequence tl dr rudeus flaw treated flaw context story ofcourse societal consequence action people punish go jail everything world mean individual character rudeus hurt action forgive using example two redemption story silent voice shouya bullying shouko led getting bullied destroyed school life suffered anxiety lost confidence ultimately ending attempting suicide shouko life get fucked much attends special school friendship fall apart consequence thats show bullying someone flaw horrible action everything forgiven later shouya utmost best atone apologise vinland saga thorfin killing people lead life absolutely fucked thousand people resent suffers hatred ptsd family destroyed hate even sleep everything properly see nightmare every single night consequence thats show murdering killing people problem horrible action everything get better thorfinn either demon regret tragedy horror stick happens mt well rudeus sexually assault little girl steal panty grope sleeping think grooming problem little girl rape end saying adult paul rape woman said woman year later rape back entertains wife pregnant paul cheat wife said family perfectly fine argument like show know character involved horrible action call think trash joke fails present action bad light everything totally fine action character involved show consequence said horrible action eris sylphie get close kid sexually assaulted forcefully taken clothes let alone promising sex later nonsensical one grows trust issue trauma insecurity hurt character writing people expecting redemption story rudeus character go past redeemed even never face consequence,0

Whether you think it's a good enough justification or not, at least Rudeus actually does have that level of ""he was a disgusting pervert in his previous life and is being raised by a disgusting pervert in his new life"" to fall back on to explain his behavior.  But in Assassin he straight up admits to intentionally grooming all 3 of the main female cast members.  He handpicks the most vulnerable girls he can find and, if they aren't already in mortal danger then he waits for or orchestrates events that he can ""save them from"" so that they'll be permanently indebted to him forever.  They literally call it brainwashing techniques he's using to ensure that they'll be trustworthy tools to him later in life.  He also blatantly, by his own inner monologues, admits that he deliberately strings them along by playing into their clearly sexual advances towards him, with no intention of turning them down or reciprocating purely because he wants them as emotionally attached and dependent on him as possible.

Yet nobody is crying foul.  Nobody is lambasting that show for it's ""adult man in a preteen body engaging in manipulative and harmful sexual conduct.""  The show isn't even trying to leave it open to a ""the main character may actually feel remorse over this later after some character growth"" path like MT is.  Lugh just does it and we're supposed to root for him.

Feel what you want about either series.  I'm not here to condone or deny anyone's taste in shows (honestly, MT and Assassin are two of my personal top three shows of I'm following this season).  It just feels like a double standard going on just like when SAO was super popular and everyone was hating on Kirito for being a Gary Stu while Mahouka was airing just around the corner with a Gary Stu protag that was literally 100x worse, but nobody was complaining about them, only Kirito.",might bit tangent find odd dare say hypocritical world strongest assassin isekai also getting dogpiled people critical mt whether think good enough justification least rudeus actually level disgusting pervert previous life raised disgusting pervert new life fall back explain behavior assassin straight admits intentionally grooming main female cast member handpicks vulnerable girl find already mortal danger wait orchestrates event save permanently indebted forever literally call brainwashing technique using ensure trustworthy tool later life also blatantly inner monologue admits deliberately string along playing clearly sexual advance towards intention turning reciprocating purely want emotionally attached dependent possible yet nobody cry foul nobody lambasting show adult man preteen body engaging manipulative harmful sexual conduct show even trying leave open main character may actually feel remorse later character growth path like mt lugh supposed root feel want either series condone deny anyone taste show honestly mt assassin two personal top three show following season feel like double standard going like sao super popular everyone hating kirito gary stu mahouka airing around corner gary stu protag literally x worse nobody complaining kirito,0

As well him showing Eris the importance of learning new things especially if you're not good at them. And the dance scene shows that being with Rudi gives Eris confidence in doing just that.

I think Rudi realizes how his bad actions almost undone all of that in a second which is why he never does it again and also why the girls end up forgiving him.

While I would criticize that in his second life, his new father should have been more of a mentor to him in this regard, but Paul is also scummy in a similar way. As you mention throughout your analysis that this is a redemption story, I think it will take Rudy a LOT of trial and error to figure out how to be a non-deviant, as there‚Äôs just really no one there to guide him.

After the attempted rape in the barn in episode 6, Eris goes back to being tutored by Rudy like nothing happened. Even if Rudy doesn't face any immediate consequences for it, the way Eris felt about him would change. But the story just moved on like nothing happened, so why does the scene exist at all?

**My personal story**: I've tried but stopped staying up-to-date with the manga and anime for some reason; only watched until the ""post nut clarity"" line. The animation was beautifully fluid and art picturesque (coupled with quality voice acting). Though tbh, I was only drawn in and binged all first three episodes after I watched the clip of Roxy's shooting a water ball on this subreddit.

**My dilemma:** Having read quite a bit of the manga, I knew it'd be lewd. But I'm not averse to that. I welcome it, in fact. However, I believe most would understand, there's a limit to how much I can play with that and still feel good about myself.

This is where I start to realise I practically zone out when consuming uneasy stuff. It indeed felt wrong at times, but blissful, stunning, and in awe was all the feelings and thoughts I actually remembered. So, could I recommend this show? Should my opinion be unreliable, who should I trust?

To them it's just a kid being a kid, and he's redeemed himself in their eyes. To you as the viewer who knows him as a 30-year old pervert, that's not acceptable but your perspective is irrelevant for their emotions.

hlqj9ki,"First, before saying anything, I want to state that I am mostly with you. However, there are some issues with your points I would like to point out.

>Rape, grooming, slaves, servants were all relatively commonplace according to historical sources.
 
Just beacuse they are common place that does not justify them. They bring suffering to the people involved and we as audience have all the rights to hold Rudy responsible for not partaking in any of them because he should have known better. However, we should also not expect him to do anything about these issues as long as he does not contribute to the problems.

The author never justified anything objectively wrong such as human trafficking, rape, and murder as simply part of the moral codes of the world. 

A big selling point of MT for me is how the author tackles an almost philosophical question: what it means to be moral? Are we following moral standards simply because thats what our society tells us to do, or is there some other reasons? And he *shows* us in a very subtle way, through the journey of a very immoral man, that the answer is actually very simple: empathy. 

You see this is the danger of completely immersing yourself in MT's world's moral standards. You would very likely arrive at the false conclusion that moral codes is something that the society forces on its members, and it should change as society changes. This is not correct, at least not what MT trying to say. Sure enough, moral codes do change, but at the core it should be based on empathy towards one another. 

Rudy started as someone who was misunderstood, mistreated, and isolated. Hence, naturally he lacked any empathy towards anyone. This is the cause of why he did the controversal stuff he did to Sylphy and Eris. He didnt treat them as fellow humans, but rather objects that he can vent his pent up sexual desires on. However, his troubling behavior towards them recedes as he gradually bonded with them and interacted with them, to the point where it dawned to him that he *loves* them as humans, not objects. Naturally, he didnt wanted to hurt them, and when he did, he was scared and deeply regretted it. When you adopt a mindset like that, it is hard to be a rapey pervert and act disrespectfully. This extends to Rudy's family and friends, until he learned to repect everyone in general as human. This, my friend, is the true character arc of Rudy.

Many fans have framed MT as a redemption story, when it really isnt. It is a 'coming of age story', a story about a 34 years old child learning to love himself and others.",first saying anything want state mostly however issue point would like point rape grooming slave servant relatively commonplace according historical source beacuse common place justify bring suffering people involved audience right hold rudy responsible partaking known better however also expect anything issue long contribute problem author never justified anything objectively wrong human trafficking rape murder simply part moral code world big selling point mt author tackle almost philosophical question mean moral following moral standard simply thats society tell u reason show u subtle way journey immoral man answer actually simple empathy see danger completely immersing mt world moral standard would likely arrive false conclusion moral code something society force member change society change correct least mt trying say sure enough moral code change core based empathy towards one another rudy started someone misunderstood mistreated isolated hence naturally lacked empathy towards anyone cause controversal stuff sylphy eris didnt treat fellow human rather object vent pent sexual desire however troubling behavior towards recedes gradually bonded interacted point dawned love human object naturally didnt wanted hurt scared deeply regretted adopt mindset like hard rapey pervert act disrespectfully extends rudy family friend learned repect everyone general human friend true character arc rudy many fan framed mt redemption story really isnt coming age story story year old child learning love others,0

I think that is good.

Most famous Assasin Isekai for example: 70+ year old guy in the body of a 12 year old aristocrat grooming two vulnerable and destitute teenage girls: but the series pretends like this is jsut a little strange (and actually pretty nice of him and the girls love it and they say so, so what is the problem stop asking questions). The story kinda glosses over it and insist on us that the Protagonist is still a decent guy. 

Mushoku Tensei tells the viewer: yeah that is a fucked up dynamic. Let me show it to you in a drawing: 'there, you feel bad now? Good. That is how you are supposed to feel about this situation, not trying to excuse it to yourself.'

hlwrrlo,"I think both you and the OP misses the point completely though, and I think it shows what sad state Reddit is in when all it takes is to write a really long post to get a bunch of upvotes and awards, even if what you are saying isn't that smart or spectacular. There really isn't any new takes in the OP, its the same thing we've seen being rehashed here since cour 1. And frankly, the OP is wrong.

One example is the unbiased camera the OP mentions as a negative, no it isn't. OP missed the point completely, its called first person narrative. The camera is biased, yes, its from Rudeus' perspective, that is the point. Now, if you personally don't like it, that is fine, but its not some negative trait inherent to the storytelling of the show, its a deliberate choice the director has made and its brilliant, even if it does make you uncomfortable sometimes.

Another one is the idea of karmic justice and how every negative action should be punished, this is an incredibly childish view on morality and not how the world works. And would Rudeus' character development be better if this was the case? He would just change for the better because he's punished, that doesn't make him a good person.

Rudeus is inherently a good person, but that person is burried under a layer of shit. A good example is when his plans get Kurt's friend killed(those young adventurers they encountered), Rudeus' plan works brilliantly, by saving the kids at the last minute they are incredibly thankful to Dead End and will spread their good name on to others. But Rudeus still feels terrible, because he accidentally got someone killed, if he was an inherently bad person, or a psycopath, he would be happy with the outcome, but he isn't.

The only thing OP is correct in, is that the show is a hard sell. The show is incredibly slow, it moves at a snail's pace, setting things up for the future, its very much ""Game of Thrones"" in that regard. If you want instant gratification, lots of action, and actions having immediate consequences, you should watch something else.

Either way I think the scene sufficiently has a tone of condemnation both in the scene itself and throughout the series as a whole. We aren't meant to see Rudy as commendable for his behavior, most scenes where he's gross take more of critical approach rather than tacitly justifying his behavior, at least in comparison to other shows.

Any way other than that? They can still convey Rudeus' arousal and have him take the same actions and show the same character development.

 ere's one for you: shot of Eris's face, shot of Rudy looking at her face,  his eyes move down (from which the audience can imply he's looking at her vulnerable body), Rudy gulps (to be even more ""anime"" let's make it a super tight shot of that gulp), back to his face, he's thinking about it, he wavers a bit, and then we see him wall off to jerk it.

It's not too long either so if you're scared off by One Piece's and Naruto's gargantuan episode count (though I've never understood that, the more the better IMO) then this should be fine.

you can see what are essentially prototype characters and story arcs in YYH that were later used more effectively in HXH. 

i think the only thing YYH does better than HXH is that the 4 main characters have more bonding time. in HXH they get split up halfway through and pretty much never re-unite again. in YYH it's only like that in the final arc.",say good great mostly thanks togashi took shounen whole new level next work hunter x hunter see essentially prototype character story arc yyh later used effectively hxh think thing yyh better hxh main character bonding time hxh get split halfway pretty much never unite yyh like final arc,1

e0777k3,"Yu Yu Hakusho is my all-time favorite anime, and one of my favorite series in any medium/genre overall. 

It's very well-paced. They do a great job of giving the show a dark atmosphere/feel, especially for a shonen. The soundtrack is very catchy for that era. It ended at a point where you still want more, and not at a point where it's become stale and you want it to end. 

But the best part, far and away, is the characters and dialogue. A lot of shonen have good guys as their protagonists, but in Yu Yu Hakusho, the protagonist is a juvenile delinquent and the other three main characters are another delinquent and two ex-criminals, and it translates well into their actions and interactions. The supporting cast is great too, but I LOVE the main four (Yusuke, Kuwabara, Kurama, Hiei). 

And because of those character traits (and great writing), they interact in ways that are just so entertaining. Yusuke's blatant disrespect for others is often funny, as is Kuwabara's idiocy or Hiei's sarcastic barbs. When Kurama goes all out, it's dark in a way you rarely see from Shonen good guys. You all get to see them go from rivals/enemies to almost like brothers each arc, and all of them get to contribute significantly in almost every arc, unlike other shows. 

The dub is one of the few anime I've been able to rewatch over and over again and not get sick of it at all. It's very overshadowed by DBZ because of when it was released here and in Japan, but IMO it's way better.

They found that the runes were actually quotes from Goethe's Faust. Using it as a Rosetta stone, they managed to completely dechipher these runes within mere WEEKS. It becomes even better, as even the production team was surprised that 4chan cracked the code, considering even Japanese had not gone that far. The result is, that a lot of symbolism that Madoka is famous for, is found in the runes and it makes it even better once you know it. Those runes correspond to the each letter in the German alphabet, which itself is the Latin alphabet as of now. So for all 26 letters in our alphabet, there exists a rune. The madlads even went as far as to make a literal font out of it. So you can type in Madoka runes if you want to.!<

I wanted to try comparing the top 20 anime (as of Dec 31, 2023) across 6 different sites: [MAL](https://myanimelist.net/topanime.php), [AniList](https://anilist.co/search/anime/top-100), [Anime-Planet](https://www.anime-planet.com/anime/top-anime), [AniDB](https://anidb.net/anime/?h=1&noalias=1&orderby.name=1.1&orderby.rating=0.2), [Kitsu](https://kitsu.io/explore/anime/highest-rated), and [ANN](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/ratings-anime.php?top50=best_bayesian). Not to judge which rankings are better, but to show how much it varies depending on the site's userbase and rating system. I think the most interesting bit is seeing where the sites overlap, and where they don't. I used colored squares to indicate which other sites had the anime in their top 20. Some observations that stood out to me:

* There's no overlap between Kitsu and AniDB, or Kitsu and ANN
* FMAB is the anime with the most overlap (in the top 5 for all sites but Kitsu)
* Gintama has the most entries across the board
* Kitsu sure loves Demon Slayer
* The most recent anime on ANN's list are Your Name and A Silent Voice from 2016
* The most recent anime on AniDB's list is Blue Giant from 2023

This is my first time creating an infographic. Feedback welcome.

Then the Chimera Ant arc happens and it's no longer subtle, it was just very forward with how dark it was, and I wasn't a fan at first, and the pacing kind of hurt it.

Then after thinking about it for a while, then finally revisiting it, it actually is a really, really great arc. It's still not my top HxH arc (I legit can't even figure out which arc is my favorite), but when looking at it in hindsight the Chimera Ant arc starts to really show it's weight when it comes to the writing. Meruem was just an absolute phenomenal villain, and his very last scene actually got me to tear up. It's a shame that immediately after that scene we got that upbeat next episode preview with Gon's voiceover, that just completely killed the mood.",know right loved hunter x hunter fact world made feel little bit uneasy like shounen anime main character hopeful constant showing world one want live looming darkness always chimera ant arc happens longer subtle forward dark fan first pacing kind hurt x b thinking finally revisiting actually really really great arc still top hxh arc legit even figure arc favorite looking hindsight chimera ant arc start really show weight come writing meruem absolute phenomenal villain last scene actually got tear shame immediately scene got upbeat next episode preview gon voiceover completely killed mood,1

Their dialogues were great as well. It showed their personality in a day-to-day situation. The way they move, talk, respond, and interact showed a lot about their character.

I didn't find it slow at all. The first episode set the plot in motion and had a cliffhanger at the end of it.

For Mirai fuukin + the extra chorus, yeah, Ive seen both. I also felt like the main movie didnt add that much to the main story, but I would still recommend it for the bomberman and Mana Ryougi (cutest chick in the typemoon universe imo). And the extra chorus was a nice throwback/ending.
Fate Zero is also on my watchlist, Ive only seen the Kings banquet or whatever the scene is called, but that was pretty good in its own regard, since I found the speech from Gilgamesh amazing. (If I didnt confuse the name here ;__; Been a while)

Also there's a ton of blatant and unnecessary fanservice which can be irritating considering the series wants to take itself seriously.

d5n7emb,"Yeah, I recommend Fate/Zero over Fate/Stay Night.  Stay Night is better eyecandy because it's newer, but F/Z is a better told story IMO (written by the same guy who did Psycho-Pass actually). 

For a slightly longer description of Satoshi Kon stuff so you can better choose what to get into (sorry for geeking out, but the guy is one of my favorite all time writers and he only ever made five anime before he died):

Paprika is visually the most intriguing, and has some moments that I think are extraordinary in how much deeper meaning is packed in. Overall though I think it's less focused than his other films.

Perfect Blue is considered by most to be his best. It's a really well written psychological thriller that manages to be creepy and unsettling through and through. Any more would be spoilers.

Millennium Actress is my personal favorite anime of all time. Most people don't end up liking it as much as Perfect Blue, and with good reason. It's not for everyone. That said I'd argue that it's the most focused of his films, as everything in it drives at a really impactful final message.

Paranoia Agent is his only series and was almost my favorite of his. It's a dark and intriguing series of vignettes that all are all tied together in one big bizarre mystery, I just took a couple of issues with one specific thing in the last episode that knocks it down a peg for me.

Lastly, Tokyo Godfathers is not what I'd choose to get into Kon with. It's basically what would happen if he decided to make a Ghibli film, and is the only one of his that doesn't heavily blend fantasy and reality and stays heavily grounded in an easily tangible story. That said, it's a good heartwarming christmasy film. Just not exactly what you think of when you think of Kon. 

And yeah, Mana makes Extra Chorus worth it alone. I think the side stories did an amazing job of making the entire series feel tied up and complete as well (not that 7 wasn't already an amazing finisher, but for those of us who wanted more it was nice).

Lastly, since we seem to have similar taste (PP, Hyouka, and Baccano! happen to be in my 9/10s, which I reserve for shows that I consider absolute favorites), I'll drop my favorite shows [4x4](http://i.imgur.com/hEHhuYH.jpg) here in case anything else catches your fancy (though I've already mentioned a lot on it). If you have anything in your favorites that you'd like to drop for me as well I'd appreciate it since we seem to like similar stuff and I'm always looking for new shows.

It's worth looking in to but to sum it up the author was unhappy with how it was going and didn't even want to do Act 2 but he felt obliged to.

He suffered from severe depression because of this and in the end it was a bit forced and the ending was apparently mediocre. I haven't read it myself in hopes it is at least animated which is unlikely since the manga series ended, but maybe I'll read it some day. Some people are hoping he returns after a long break and with a fresh mindset to re-write the ending and continue the story but it's not looking hopeful.

As shit as Ging is, Gon had a peaceful life, until he on his own, decided to jump into a world of death and violence.

While Killua had the needle, it was only because he's was not ready to fight, skill wise. Once Silva and Zeno find out that he's removed the needle, they make no attempt to inset the needle again and they're glad that he's capable of fighting. 

Killua had no choice, from his birth he was destined to be surrounded by death and violence, he was tortured, poisoned, abused, so he could become a murderer. Silva is not protecting him out of love(even if he tells himself that he does), he's protecting him out greed, he's protecting an investment. It is clear that some Zoldyck children are less wanted than others and it correlates directly to their power or ability to help the family. 


Gon had a choice, Killua didn't. If the Zoldycks truly loved their children they would not turn them into assassins, at the very least they'd give them an option like Ging gave to Gon.

Bottom line they're both shit parents, but only one of them forced his kid to a life of suffering.",disagree ging set test could potentially kill gon silva least instills son stay away danger shit ging gon peaceful life decided jump world death violence killua needle ready fight skill wise silva zeno find removed needle make attempt inset needle glad capable fighting killua choice birth destined surrounded death violence tortured poisoned abused could become murderer silva protecting love even tell protecting greed protecting investment clear zoldyck child less wanted others correlate directly power ability help family gon choice killua zoldycks truly loved child would turn assassin least give option like ging gave gon bottom line shit parent one forced kid life suffering,0
